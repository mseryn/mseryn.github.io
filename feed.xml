Some of the advanced topics are out of date, however, and some of the practices are outdated.</p> <p>An example is <em>putting all variable declarations at the top of a file</em> - this is now an anti-pattern as it ineffectively uses memory. It had a place in the past, but no longer. Another example is <em>declaring variables in if/else-if statements</em> - this is also not recommended, as it causes unexpected side-effects and can be hard to read. A better method is to define variables as-needed around if/else-if statements and use the variables. Exceptions, of course, are made for loop-contained variables, especially indices and similar in for/while loops. In general though, <em>don’t have your code have side-effects</em>!</p> <p>The K&amp;R was written by the people who designed and wrote C. These people are legends! And their insight into their language is amazing. So do read the book! But remember - it’s not the end-all.</p> <p>That said, here’s a short reading guide:</p> <h3 id="chapters-1-2-3-and-4">Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4</h3> <p>are your basics of C. Syntax, types, loops, functions, and basic compilation - you’ll do a hello-world here, for example.</p> <h4 id="pitfall-topics">Pitfall topics:</h4> <h5 id="sec-110-variables-and-scope">Sec 1.10: Variables and scope.</h5> <p>This topic is easy to mess up in C, and the resulting errors can be a <em>hassle</em> to identify.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="book-reviews"/><category term="book-review"/><category term="teaching-materials"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The K and R book is awesome - I've reread it to teach a course!]]></summary></entry></feed>
