        This book:
        <ul>
            <li>Stands the test of time</li>
            <li>Respects the reader</li>
            <li>while still being approachable</li>
            <li>Has examples, examples, and more examples</li>
        </ul>

        Expected read-time is <strong>10-20 hours</strong> -- it really depends on your experience and comfort with C.

### Disclaimer
**Please remember this book was published in 1988!**

It's absolutely fabulous as an intro. Some of the advanced topics are out of date, however, and some of the practices are outdated.

An example is *putting all variable declarations at the top of a file* - this is now an anti-pattern as it ineffectively uses memory.
It had a place in the past, but no longer.
Another example is *declaring variables in if/else-if statements* - this is also not recommended, as it causes unexpected side-effects and can be hard to read.
A better method is to define variables as-needed around if/else-if statements and use the variables.
Exceptions, of course, are made for loop-contained variables, especially indices and similar in for/while loops. 
In general though, *don't have your code have side-effects*!

The K&R was written by the people who designed and wrote C. These people are legends! And their insight into their language is amazing.
So do read the book! But remember - it's not the end-all.

That said, here's a short reading guide:

### Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4
are your basics of C. Syntax, types, loops, functions, and basic compilation - you'll do a hello-world here, for example.

#### Pitfall topics:

##### Sec 1.10: Variables and scope.
This topic is easy to mess up in C, and the resulting errors can be a _hassle_ to identify.
