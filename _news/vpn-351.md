CS 351-CUG students should have access to their IIT VPN and the course server, Fourier. Please use [this guide](https://ots.iit.edu/network-infrastructure/vpn-setup-and-connect-using-cisco-anyconnect-windows) to install your VPN. Check your email for Fourier login credentials, and use ssh username@fourier.cs.iit.edu -- or use [Putty](https://www.putty.org/) if you're on Windows.
