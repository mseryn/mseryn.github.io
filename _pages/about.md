My name is Melanie Cornelius. I'm a PhD candidate in HPC currently finishing the degree at the [University of Chicago at Illinois](uic.edu). I'm excited to be here!

This Fall, 2023, I'm teaching CS 331 at the [Illinois Institute of Technology](iit.edu). If you're here for course information, head over to the course webpage.

I earned a BS in physics (minor in CS) and a MS in CS from the [Illinois Institute of Technology](iit.edu) in 2016 and 2018, respectively.

I like HPC. My focus is on performance monitoring/analytics, and the lofty goal is to make HPC work better for everyone. I focus on work with intersecting theory and empiricism. I have a weird obsession with making graphs as self-explanatory as possible. I start to whither away if I go too long without teaching. When I'm not spending time with my family, I also garden (weirdly common in CS). I read a lot, sometimes even for fun! Old-school SciFi is my thing, and also [Dresden Files](https://www.jim-butcher.com/books/dresden). Predictibly, I like coffee too much.

If you want to chat, send me an email or schedule something via [calendy](https://calendly.com/melanie-e-cornelius).
